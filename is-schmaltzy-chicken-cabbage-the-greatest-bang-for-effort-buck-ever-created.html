<p>Everybody in our gang cooked Smitten Kitchen’s <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/04/roast-chicken-with-schmaltzy-cabbage/">roast chicken with schmaltzy cabbage</a> last year. It was the ultimate Pandemic Food: simple, rich, comforting, simple, chickeny, schmaltzy. On the weekend we returned to it after several months without (the pandemic goes on and on, after all), and it remains The Greatest. Never not be eating <span class="small-caps">SCC</span>.</p>
